# Iris K-Means Clustering

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates K-Means clustering on the Iris dataset. It helps find patterns in the data and visualize clusters based on the features of the iris flowers.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the `kmeans_iris.py` script to see the clustering results.
3. The script will display the Elbow Method graph to find the optimal number of clusters and visualize the clusters.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7+
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Results

The script applies K-Means clustering to the Iris dataset, providing insights into how the flowers can be grouped based on their features.
